**I am working on the paper by Neubert and Caswell (1997): (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2266047) on measures of perturbations to an ecological system. The paper has some errors in their computation of reactivity and amplification envelope in the 1984 transfer matrix. I am trying to do all the computations again in MATLAB and I am trying to do a proper review for the paper with more mathematical details.**
