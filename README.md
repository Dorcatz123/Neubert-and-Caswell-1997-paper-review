**I am working on the paper by Neubert and Caswell (1997): (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2266047) on measures of perturbations to an ecological system. The paper has errors in their computation of reactivity and amplification envelope in the 1984 transfer matrix (check the Neubert and Caswell review ppt page 19 -page 20 for the difference in the calculations). I am trying to do all the computations in MATLAB and I am also doing a proper review for the paper with more mathematical details as presented in my Neubert and Caswell review pdf**
